# Hello World! Hello Steemit Community! I'm not a big fan of New Year's resolutions, but this time I do have one!

Dear Steemit community,

first and foremost: **Hi and a happy new year!** My name is Robert and I have been a reader of steemit posts for quite some time. Now as a New Year's resolution I decided to become an active party in this community. To be fair, I did register last year, but my account confirmation took some time. I guess many of you know how it feels to constantly hit the refresh button of your inbox... but I digress.

So who am I (i.e. the guy in the picture above) and what can you expect from me? I am a former theoretical Neuroscientist. If you now imagine wet science with dissecting brains, I have to disappoint you. Theoretical Neuroscience is more about Math and Computer Science and trying to figure out ways to describe the brain by differential equations. After figuring out that this skill is rather pointless if you do not want to pursue an academic career, I switched to Data Science and Machine Learning. I still keep doing this as a professional and I will share some insights with you. 

Besides, I got -- as many of you around here -- infected by the Cryptocurrency fever. If I remember correctly it hit me on one weekend in June. I wanted to go to a music festival, already packed up most of my stuff, got the tickets ready... and then had a bike accident! I ended up with a dislocated shoulder and, consequently, a free lonesome weekend since all my friends went to the aforementioned festival. With nothing to do accept bathing in self-pity, I randomly browsed the StackExchange sites and stumbled upon the Ethereum platform. I got immediately hooked and spent the entire weekend (and do not tell my employer, but most of the next two working days) absorbing any information I could find about Bitcoin, Blockchains, and Ethereum. Oh my god, Ethereum, a Blockchain that allows Turing complete computations, my geek heart exploded!!!!111111337

About half a year and a couple of attempts to play around with Ethereum and other Cryptocurrencies later, I ended up here and want to share some of my discoveries with you. I promise, I won't be spamming on a daily basis, but if I do post, I'll try to publish new and quality content about my experiments and endeavours I did in the realm of Crypto, Machine Learning, and, who knows, maybe even Neuroscience. As a warning, my posts might be sprinkled with occasional dark humor.

Finally, a little teaser about what I've been working on recently, and what I most likely will be posting about some time soon:

* Overseeing your Blockfolio with an IPython Notebook
* How to write a little Multiplayer Game for Ethereum
* Hitler + Putin = Erdogan: Strange insights from analysing online user comments
* How to sell your soul (!) on the Blockchain

Most of my projects and the corresponding source code can also be found [on my Github profile](https://github.com/SmokinCaterpillar) (to verify that this really my Github, check where the image is hosted and this text is backed up ;-) ). That's about it and I wish you all a happy and successfull new year 2018!
