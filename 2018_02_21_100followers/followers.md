Recently, I celebrated my [100th comment](https://steemit.com/steemit/@smcaterpillar/my-100th-post-on-steemit-time-for-a-short-recap), and now is the time for another jubilee of a similar order of magnitude. I just gained more than **100** followers. Yay! Thanks Steemit Community!

When I started in January I never expected such a great warm welcome, [my introduction post](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@smcaterpillar/hello-world-hello-steemit-community-i-m-not-a-big-fan-of-new-year-s-resolutions-but-this-time-i-do-have-one) immediately got some traction and, consequently, I was hooked on Steemit right from the start. However, I also had to learn that less popular topics - under less popular tags than *introduceyourself* - can get quickly unnoticed and buried among the sheer masses of daily new posts.

I want to use this celebration post to advertise a project of mine that tries to mitigate this problem to some extend. I wrote a new Steemit **bot that supports minnows and content curators** by searching for quality content that got less reward and attention than it deserves. This little fella is called @trufflepig and you can find his latest discoveries - just made a couple of minutes ago - [HERE IN THIS TOP LIST](https://steemit.com/steemit/@trufflepig/daily-truffle-picks-2018-02-21).

The bot is based on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It goes through all posts published one week before and looks at the payouts they achieved. From this dataset it tries to learn rules and statistics to determine what makes up a good Steemit post based on the judgment and rewards provided by the Steemit community. In order to infer these rules, it looks at a post's topic and content as well as style features such as average paragraph lengths, spelling mistakes, or readability scores. [You can find a detailed explanation here](https://steemit.com/steemit/@smcaterpillar/trufflepig-introducing-the-artificial-intelligence-for-content-curation-and-minnow-support).


The bot is very new and in its infant stage. So, it will inevitably make some mistakes and you may disagree with many of its suggestions. So I need your help. Following, upvoting and resteeming the bot's post will cover the server costs as well as further development. Moreover, your feedback and comments are very welcomed and will help to improve it.


Thanks a lot! Now @trufflepig and I are aiming for the next milestone: **1000 followers!** Cheers!
