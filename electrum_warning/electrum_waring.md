# Warning: The Electrum Bitcoin Wallet has been compromised! Fix has been issued today!


The famous Electrum bitcoin wallet is susceptible to JavaScript attacks.
See [this BitcoinTalk announcment](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2702103.0), this [official tweet](https://twitter.com/ElectrumWallet/status/950163143082299392), and this [github issue](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3374).

If you had open Electrum in the past in combination with an open webbrowser, your security and Bitcoin were at risk.

If you **did not set an Electrum passphrase for your wallet**, you should upgrade Electrum immediatly and move your Bitcoin to a new wallet!

If you had a passphrase protection, you should also upgrade, but your funds still may be secure! In this case an attacker could "only" get address and transaction information from your wallet and change your Electrum settings.

You can download the new and fixed [version 3.0.5 here](https://electrum.org/#download).
