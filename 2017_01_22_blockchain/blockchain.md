We all, myself included, love Cryptocurrencies and the underlying Blockchain technology (or DAG for IOTA or block lattice in case of RaiBlocks). However, recently things got a littel out of hand. Just adding the term *Blockchain* to your company's name can [make the stocks double](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/21/long-island-iced-tea-micro-cap-adds-blockchain-to-name-and-stock-soars.html) and other companies are trying to [do the same](https://www.techspot.com/news/72430-more-companies-adding-blockchain-their-name-profiting-cryptocurrency.html).

Maybe, we should brace ourseves, here. If you ask yourself if your company should boad on the hype, I made something to help with your decision.
