Almost all of us, myself included, love Cryptocurrencies and the underlying Blockchain technology (or DAG or block lattice, but I digress). However, recently things got a little out of hand. For example, having an almost empty Github repo with Blockchain in its title [may lead to a (temporary) market capitalization of more than 250 million $](https://steemit.com/blockchain/@smcaterpillar/iot-chain-china-s-new-iota-an-easy-investment-or-should-we-set-off-the-alarm-bells-let-s-do-our-homework). Moreover, just adding *Blockchain* to your company's name can [make its stock price double](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/21/long-island-iced-tea-micro-cap-adds-blockchain-to-name-and-stock-soars.html) and more and more companies are trying to [do the same](https://www.techspot.com/news/72430-more-companies-adding-blockchain-their-name-profiting-cryptocurrency.html).

Maybe, we should contain our excitement a bit...
