Many of you probably heave heard that that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a powerful tool in Machine Learning. They are used to drive autonomous cars [1] or master the game of Go [2], for example. Although being capable of human or even super human performance, the neurons in these networks are very rough and basic abstractions of real biological nerve cells. This has two reasons. On the one hand, mathematically speaking artificial neural networks are just function approximators, so biological details would rather be a burden and slow down calculations. On the other hand, already single nerve cells show a vast complexity of biochemical processes which are not completly undestood, let alone can be simulated as a whole.

Realizing these problems, some scientists had the idea to screw simulations all together and use real neurons for Machine Learning instead.
