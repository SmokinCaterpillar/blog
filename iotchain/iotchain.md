# IoT Chain: China's new IOTA? An easy investment or should we set off the alarm bells? Let's do our homework!

Recently a new coin called IoT Chain made some headlines in the
[Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-beginners-guide-to-iot-chain-the-iota-of-china_us_5a4a4edee4b06cd2bd03e183).
Besides drowning the reader in buzzwords, the authors claim that IoT Chain
is a new Chinese blockchain like technology that allows fast payments among IoT devices
and facilitates IoT data security.
For the less technically inclined reader: IoT is short for the *Internet of Terror*.
This means your toaster is hooked up to the internet and refuses to toast your slice of bread until you pay a ransom
of some Bitcoin to the guys who just hacked it. But I digress.

Of course, IoT Chain making it into the Huffington Post
left its mark on the coin's market capitalization.
According to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iot-chain/),
by the time of writing, it has surpassed 250 billion USD and keeps on growing.

I have to admit, seeing this monstrous rise, I got interested.
Did I miss a good opportunity for an investment? Or is there a chance that
IoT Chain will further climb to the top Cryptcurrencies, much like NEO, the
supposed Ethereum of China?

As many Crypto investors I like the thrill of finding lesser known coins, assets, or technologies that
have the potential to grow big and yield massive returns. I was lucky enough to invest early on into IOTA
and bought RaiBlocks when ist was still in the lower single digits. However, I try not to blindly throw
money at various projects. I rather do some research first, that is skim whitepapers
(or if it's mind blowing dive really deep into it),
look at the developing team and the community (mostly BitcoinTalk), try out wallets, and,
since I am a coder myself, check-out the git repository. So let us do that!

### The Whitepaper

Let's start with the positive aspect(s). Well, at least they do
have a white paper and it is [available online](https://iotchain.io/pdf/ITCWHITEPAPER.pdf).
Unfortunately, that's about it. The paper itself is only staggering 25 pages long!
Sure, there are genius publications of as similar order of magnitude. For example,
[Claude Shannon's Master thesis](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/greatworks/shannon38.pdf)
(which is more famous than his Ph.D.) is also only 25 pages long, but laid the
groundwork to linking Boolean algebra and circuit design. To do just that
the paper is scattered with tons of equations. The IoT Chain whitepaper,
on the other hand, lists not even a single equation!

Of course, quantity of math may not always be a good metric
for judging tech publications. Maybe the whitepaper can convey
their genius setup even without any rigorous math and, no kidding,
double line spacing. Yet, they start off wasting 8 of their 25 precious pages on
describing how big the market of IoT devices will most likely grow
in the coming years and a very, very general sketch of Bitcoin and Blockchains.

Next, they give a very rough overview of their systems' potential layout. They want to combine
the practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm, of which variants are applied
by renowned coins such as Stellar or Ripple, with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure as utulized by IOTA.
The details of the combination of the technologies, however,
are apparently left as an exercise to the reader.


### The Team and Community

Following the LinkedIn profiles listed on their [website](https://iotchain.io/)
is not the most insightful endeavour either. The profiles of the CEO as well as CTO
are rather dim. At least their CFO has some skill endorsements.
Hence, most likely cashflow won't be a problem for them.

Moreover, the [community on BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2612309.0)
resembles an abandonded desert ghost town. It lists only 3 pages for *the* IOTA of China?!

### The Wallet

If somebody would be so kind to point out to me where exactly I can find
the wallet? The website's *Download Center* only lists the whitepaper.

Oh wait, the Roadmap says the wallet won't be available until the end
of May. But how come that their coin is
[traded on exchanges like OKEx](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iot-chain/#markets)?
Please, do not tell me it is
[this simple ERC20 Ethereum token](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x5e6b6d9abad9093fdc861ea1600eba1b355cd940).

### The Github Profile

Just to be clear and as a reminder,
we are talking here about a project that has a market
capitalization of more than 250 billion USD. So why does
[their Github repository](https://github.com/IoTChainCode/itc-blockchain)
comprises of only a single contributor and, brace yourself, 25
(in words twentyfive!) commits? Just to put this into perspective
the Ethereum C++ client has accumalted more than 30,000 commits, for instance.

## Oh Boy

The Cryptocurrency community should teak a break, followed by a deep
breath, and we should ask ourselves: How did we end up here?

I know, everyone is sick of hearing the evil B-word, but I have to say it: I do smell
a **bubble** here. Hopefully, I am wrong, I just caught them in a
very early stage, and IoT Chain will deliver an amazing new Blockchain or DAG solution in the far future.
However, I would always be skeptical if a project
offers a super flashy website, but everything beyond that fails to live up
to the promises made.

Maybe you can take this as a friendly reminder to do your homework before
investing, especially for high risk options such as Cryptocurrencies.
Have a nice day and happy HODLing (maybe not IoT Chain, though)!


DISCLOSURE: I hold a variety of Cryptocurrencies and tokens, IoT Chain is
not among them. Oh, and before I forget,
I also wrote a little [Python Blockfolio](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@smcaterpillar/how-much-are-my-cryptocurrency-investments-worth-a-simple-blockfolio-using-python-and-coinmarketcap),
I made 9 commits on [Github](https://github.com/SmokinCaterpillar/blockfolio), so it should be worth round about 70 - 100 billion USD ;-)
