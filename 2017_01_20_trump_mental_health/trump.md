Donald Trump took a swipe at his predecessors, Barack Obama, George Bush, and Bill Clinton, for dealing with the regime of North Korea and gave the most ridicolous reason ever why he is most capable of solving this crisis at hand:

Sure Trump is, of course, [as he modestly proclaimed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/949619270631256064?lang=en), a genius. He got himself tested! Perfect score, 30 out of 30!

Here is the thing, though: The test he underwent, called "Montreal Cognitive Assessment" designed in 1996 by Ziad Nasreddine, is by no means an IQ test to identify the mentally gifted and political Savants among us. In contrast, it solely checks for mental problems. A score of about 22 is already indicative of mild cognitive impairment. Achieve 16 points and it is highly likely you suffer from Alzheimer's disease.

Accordingly, the questions you have to answer and tasks you have to solve are not very presidential. For example, you have to be able to draw a clock, identify and name an image of a Camel (seroiusly!), or just repeat the following sentence: "The cat always hid under the couch when dogs were in the room."

I have to admit, I did doubt in the first place that Trump was even capable of this. I have to give him this: At least the President of the United States is not a vegetable!

By the way, you can test yourself if you are fit for office. The test is [freely available online](http://www.mocatest.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MoCA-New-Test-8.1-2017-04.pdf).
