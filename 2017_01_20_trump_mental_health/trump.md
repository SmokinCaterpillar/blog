Donald Trump dismissed all his predecessors dealing with the regime of North Korea and gave the most ridicolous reason ever why he is most capable of solving this crisis at hand:

Sure Trump is, of course, [as he modestly proclaimed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/949619270631256064?lang=en), a genius. He got himself tested! Perfect score, 30 out of 30!

Here is the thing, though: The test he underwent called "Montreal Cognitive Assessment" designed in 1996 by Ziad Nasreddine is by no means an IQ test to identify the mentally gifted and savants among us. In contrast, it solely tests for mental impairments. A score of about 22 is already indicative of mild cognitive impairment. Achieve 16 points and it is highly likely you suffer from Alzheimer's disease.

Accordingly, the questions you have to answer and tasks you have to solve are not very presidential. For example, you have to be able to identify and name an image of a Camel (seroiusly!) or just repeat the following sentence: "The cat always hid under the couch when dogs were in the room.".

I have to admit, I did doubt in the first place that Trump was even capable of this. At least the president of the United States is not a vegetable!

By the way, you can test yourself if your fit for office, the test is [freely available online](http://www.mocatest.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MoCA-New-Test-8.1-2017-04.pdf).
