## It is hard to keep up with all Steemit Posts!

Steemit can be a tough place for minnows, as new users are often called. I had to learn this myself. Due to the incredible amount of new posts that are published by the minute, it is incredibly hard to stand out from the crowd. Often even nice, well-researched, and well-crafted posts of minnows get buried in the noise because they do not benefit from a lot of influential followers that could upvote their quality posts. Hence, their contributions are getting lost long before one or the other whale could notice them and turn them into trending topics.

However, this user based curation also has its merits, of course. You can become fortunate and your nice posts get traction and the recognition they deserve. Maybe we can find a way to support the Steemit content curators such that high quality content does not go unnoticed anymore. I have a proposition to do exactly this with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). **I propose `TrufflePig` a new bot that digs for hidden Steemit gems (or truffles if you like) that were overlooked by the curation crowd**.

## Let Machine Learning Help the Steemit Community

My name is [Robert](https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@smcaterpillar/hello-world-hello-steemit-community-i-m-not-a-big-fan-of-new-year-s-resolutions-but-this-time-i-do-have-one), I am a Data Scientist and do Machine Learning for a living. I also have experience [with using Articifial Intelligence to analyse written texts and documents](https://steemit.com/technology/@smcaterpillar/hitler-putin-erdogan-what-can-an-artificial-intelligence-learn-from-user-comments-youtube).

The basic idea is to use well paid posts of the past as training examples to teach an Artificial Intelligence how high quality Steemit content looks like. In turn, the trained AI can be used to identify high quality content that was missed by the curation community and did receive much less payment than it deserved. Currently I have the following plan for the `TrufflePig` bot:

* The bot will be regularly trained on new Steemit posts to identify currently trending topics.

* It will also vote on overlooked and undervalued posts (so you may delegate Steem Power to it if you like to support minnows).

* In addition, it will publish a list of the top undervalued contributions once or twice a week. Payouts of these top-posts may cover the server costs (and direct attention to undervalued posts, of course).

* Later in the future, there will be an API and/or website available where you can post your own texts before publishing to get an estimate of their value.

You haven't heard the best part of this proposal, yet. **This is not just a vague idea, but I already experimented a bit and the results look promising! I have coded a simple prototype to showcase that a bot can be used to help with the Steemit curation. I'll post the results tomorrow**. However, so far the prototype is an offline version and rather a proof of concept. I still need to create a well tested code project, setup a proper bot that runs on a dedicated server, and maybe even establish a full Steemit node to allow better data crunching for the training of the Machine Learning method.

So what can you do? You can help me by **upvoting and resteeming this post as well as my other post about the prototype**. The payout will help to cover initial development as well as server costs. The project itself will most likely be open sourced some time soon and published on my Github account. However, I won't make any promises, yet, about the associated license (i.e. MIT vs rights reserved). Furthermore, I have to see whether it make sense to develop under the patronage of utopian.

I will come up with a proper roadmap in a couple of days, and, of course, will keep blogging about the development of the bot. So stay tuned! Leave your feedback and suggestion in the comments! And don't forget to checkout the prototype of `TrufflePig`.
